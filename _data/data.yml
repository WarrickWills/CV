    info:
      - role: Senior Engineer
        time: March 2019 - Present
        company: Xero, Wellington/Auckland
        details: |
          I work in the Integration team in the Platform Technology department at Xero. At my time here I have architected, managed, built or worked on over 
          40 components, across a range of language and technology stacks, integrating with a multitude of internal and third party systems. 
          The components I primarily work on are back end worker or API components, built as either containers or lambdas.

          The technologies I have used working on back end components at Xero primary consist of C#, .NET, Node.JS, Kotlin and SQL. 
          The technologies I have used working on front end components at Xero primarily consist of React and ASP.NET Razor.

          My team is heavily involved in the graduate program, and over the last three years I have been the main mentor for many of these developers. 
          I have buddied with six people, with my job being their main contact for mentorship, guidance, explanation and code review. 
          Many of these developers have decided to stay with our team after the program, which consists of four rotations, and work as associates on our team. 
          This is a testament to the fact that they enjoyed working as a part of our team.

          The nature of my work means I use AWS services on a daily basis. Some of the key cloud computing/infrastructure tools and how I have used them include:
            - Deploying and maintaining highly available, fault-tolerant web application architecture using AWS services such as ECS, EC2, SNS, SQS, and Lambda.
            - Building and maintaining scalable distributed data processing pipelines using AWS S3, Lambda, and SQS.
            - Implementing and managing infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation, enabling infrastructure deployment and management to be automated and version-controlled.
            - Designing and maintaining highly available and performant DNS infrastructure using AWS Route 53.
            - Using AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting of critical system metrics.
            - Collaborating with cross-functional teams to design, deploy and operate complex applications on AWS, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and security.
          Some of my key achievements pertaining to project work include:
            - Original and primary developer of our teams largest integration, consisting of 32 different deployables used to move data from a range of different source systems into Salesforce. 
            - This integration alone processes 18.6 million events per month, and this number is continually growing. The primary technologies I have used to build these event data flows include: AWS ECS, SQS, SNS, Lambda, and Apache Kafka. I have worked with a number of external clients to onboard and manage the processing of external data in order to generate leads, manage virtual and in-person events, and obtain sales and marketing insights amongst other things.
            - Built a custom fit integration to automate the processing of discount events for Xero partners. The primary technologies I have used to build this application is AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and Event Store.
            - Worked in a team to build an API solution for surfacing a range of business objects from Salesforce for use by our Sales and Marketing teams. The primary technologies I have used to build this application is AWS ECS, ELB and Route 53.
            - Created, architected or worked on a number of integrations for internal clients such as our Data Services team, our Customer Experience team, our sales and our Marketing department.
            - Won our department's internal hackathon 2 times.
          Some key achievements pertaining to the improvement of team function:
            - I have been heavily involved in the inception and implementation of our Agile process. I presented a proposal for improvements to our Agile practices. I introduced the use of Kanban for measuring workflow and implementing WIP limits. I created an agile manifesto for our team to follow containing the practices we are adhering to and templates for how to create tasks, spec them out and collaborate effectively.
            - Improvements to our DevOps practices.
            - Improvements to our development practices.

      - role: Full Stack Developer
        time: May 2017 - February 2019
        company: IMPAC Services, Wellington
        details: |
          I was part of an agile, cross-functional team tasked with
          replacing a 12-year-old cloud-based Health and Safety
          Management system. We built this platform from the ground up using
          technologies including Angular 4+, .NET Core, and
          various third-party frameworks.

          Rapidly building a depth of understanding of new languages and
          concepts enabled me to assume a lead role within the team,
          coaching other developers and conceptualising and building the software
          architecture. I worked closely with our product owner, business
          analyst, UX designer and tester on a daily basis, developing
          iteratively and incrementally to ensure what we were building is fit
          for purpose and will delight our clients.

          Prior to this I also worked on IMPAC's legacy system, which included converting
          multiple modules from classic ASP to ASP.NET. Expanding on
          this, I architected and implemented a new mobile application which
          includes a range of core functionality which was heavily used by our client
          base and the implementation of new features, including capturing
          and tracking Geolocation data.
      - role: Web/Mobile Developer
        time: March 2016 - February 2017
        company: Freelance, Auckland/Wellington
        details: |
          - Worked in a team of 3 to create an Android application which
            converts UML state charts into high level rehabilitation plans for
            patients. I outlined and built our back-end architecture and
            worked on the core features, primarily the ability to convert the
            state charts into Java code compatible with Android.
          - Created a website for an NZ based Automotive company.
