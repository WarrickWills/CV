      - role: Senior Engineer
        time: March 2019 - Present
        company: Xero, Wellington/Auckland
        details: |
          I work in the Integration team within the Platform Technology department at Xero. During my time here, I have architected, managed, built, or worked on 
          over 40 components, across a range of languages and technology stacks, integrating with a multitude of internal and third-party systems. 
          The work I primarily do consists of the implementation of backend workers or API components, built as either containers or lambdas.

          The technologies I have used while working on back end components at Xero primary consist of C#, .NET, Node.JS, Kotlin and SQL. 
          The technologies I have used while working on front end components at Xero primarily consist of React and ASP.NET Razor.

          My team is heavily involved in the graduate program, and over the last three years, I have been the primary mentor for many of these developers.
          Over this period, I have worked closely with six graduates and one intern, serving as their main point of contact for mentorship, guidance, explanations, and code review.
          Many of these developers have decided to stay with our team after completing the program, which consists of four rotations in different teams at Xero, 
          and work as associates. This is a testament to the fact that they enjoyed being part of our team, and the mentoring that they received.

          The nature of my work means that I use AWS services on a daily basis. Some of the key cloud computing and infrastructure tools I have used, and how I have used them include:
            - Deploying and maintaining highly available, fault-tolerant web application architecture using AWS services such as ECS, EC2, SNS, SQS, and Lambda.
            - Building and maintaining scalable distributed data processing pipelines using AWS S3, Lambda, and SQS.
            - Implementing and managing infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation, enabling infrastructure deployment and 
            management to be automated and version-controlled.
            - Designing and maintaining highly available and performant DNS infrastructure using AWS Route 53.
            - Using AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting of critical system metrics.
            - Collaborating with cross-functional teams to design, deploy and operate complex applications on AWS, ensuring optimal performance, 
            scalability, and security.

          Some of my key achievements pertaining to project work include:
            - Being the original and primary developer of our team's largest integration used to move data from a range of  different source systems into Salesforce.
              - Consisting of 32 different deployables.
              - This integration alone processes 18.6 million events per month, and this number is continually growing.  
              - I have worked with a number of external clients to onboard and  manage the processing of external data in order to generate leads, 
              manage virtual and in-person events, and obtain sales and marketing insights, among other things.
              - The primary technologies I used to build these event data flows include AWS ECS, SQS, SNS, Lambda, and Apache Kafka.
            - Building a custom-fit integration to automate the processing of discount events for Xero partners.
              - The primary technologies I used to build this application are AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and Event Store.
            - Working in a team to build an API solution for surfacing a range of business objects from Salesforce for use by our Sales and Marketing teams.
              - The primary technologies I used to build this application are AWS ECS, ELB and Route 53.
            - Creating, architecting, or working on a number of integrations for internal clients such as our Data Services team, our Customer Experience team, 
            our Sales, and our Marketing department.
            - Winning our department's internal hackathon twice.

          Some of my key achievements pertaining to the improvement of team function include:
            - The inception and implementation of our Agile process. 
              - Presented a proposal for improvements to our Agile practices. 
              - Introduced the use of Kanban for measuring workflow and implementing WIP limits.
              - Restructured our meeting ceremonies to be more fit for purpose as our team structures changed.
              - Created an Agile manifesto for our team to follow, containing the practices we are adhering to and templates for how to create tasks, 
              spec them out, and collaborate effectively.
            - Improvements to, and adoption of our DevOps practices.
              - Developed automated CI/CD pipelines for our integrations using TeamCity and Octopus.
              - Introduced the adoption of Trunk Based Developlemt.
              - Enabled automated deployment via a fully integrated testing suite, including Unit, System, component, Contract, and end-to-end Integration tests.
            - Improvements to, and adoption of our development practices.
              - Introduced TDD and ping-pong programming.
              - Introduced Pomodoro timer time-boxed paired development.
              - Introduced system metaphor documentation for our components to outline their function for external users of our systems.

      - role: Full Stack Developer
        time: May 2017 - February 2019
        company: IMPAC Services, Wellington
        details: |
          I was part of an agile, cross-functional team tasked with
          replacing a 12-year-old cloud-based Health and Safety
          Management system. We built this platform from the ground up using
          technologies including Angular 4+, .NET Core, and
          various third-party frameworks.

          Rapidly building a depth of understanding of new languages and
          concepts enabled me to assume a lead role within the team,
          coaching other developers and conceptualising and building the software
          architecture. I worked closely with our product owner, business
          analyst, UX designer and tester on a daily basis, developing
          iteratively and incrementally to ensure what we were building is fit
          for purpose and will delight our clients.

          Prior to this I also worked on IMPAC's legacy system, which included converting
          multiple modules from classic ASP to ASP.NET. Expanding on
          this, I architected and implemented a new mobile application which
          includes a range of core functionality which was heavily used by our client
          base and the implementation of new features, including capturing
          and tracking Geolocation data.
      - role: Web/Mobile Developer
        time: March 2016 - February 2017
        company: Freelance, Auckland/Wellington
        details: |
          - Worked in a team of 3 to create an Android application which
            converts UML state charts into high level rehabilitation plans for
            patients. I outlined and built our back-end architecture and
            worked on the core features, primarily the ability to convert the
            state charts into Java code compatible with Android.
          - Created a website for an NZ based Automotive company.
