      - role: Full Stack Developer
        time: May 2017 - February 2019
        company: IMPAC Services, Wellington
        details: |
          I was part of an agile, cross-functional team tasked with
          replacing a 12-year-old cloud-based Health and Safety
          Management system. We built the platform from the ground up using
          technologies, including Angular 4+, .NET Core, and
          various third-party frameworks.

          Rapidly building a depth of understanding of new languages and
          concepts enabled me to assume a lead role within the team,
          coaching other developers and conceptualising and building the software
          architecture. I worked closely with our product owner, business
          analyst, UX designer and tester on a daily basis, developing
          iteratively and incrementally to ensure what we are building is fit
          for purpose and will delight our clients.

          Prior to this I also worked on the existing system, which included converting
          multiple modules from classic ASP to ASP.NET. Expanding on
          this, I architected and implemented a new mobile application which
          includes a range of core functionality which was heavily used by our client
          base and the implementation of new features, including capturing
          and tracking Geolocation data.
      - role: Web/Mobile Developer
        time: March 2016 - February 2017
        company: Freelance, Auckland/Wellington
        details: |
          - Worked in a team of 3 to create an Android application which
            converts UML state charts into high level rehabilitation plans for
            patients. I outlined and built our back-end architecture and
            worked on the core features, primarily the ability to convert the
            state charts into Java code compatible with Android.
          - Created a website for an NZ based Automotive company.
